# GPGameTemplate
Template for F20GP and F21GP (2020)

This is a Heriott-Watt C++/Shaders project consisting in a game via OpenGL, in collaboration with Alexandre Sarah, both of us from ESIEA Engeenering Schools. We try here to implement some physical interactions with the aid of
the University Game Template they provided us.

It requires Visual Studio to launch the program -> A concern of ressources forced us to not draw everything on the screen, as the computing is heavier while printing a specific limits of 3D Objects. (Uncomment int the main function the lines that would be drawn on
the scene, beware of the process slowing down)


Controls -> Up,Right,Left and Down Keys to control the red litte cube.
Aerial Point of view -> Q,W,S and D Keys to control the camera view.
